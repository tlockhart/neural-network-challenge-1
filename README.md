# Student Loan Repayment Prediction Neural Network

## Summary

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a machine learning model designed to predict student loan repayment likelihood. The project is aimed at a company specializing in student loan refinancing. By accurately predicting whether a borrower will repay their loan, the company can offer more precise interest rates, benefiting both the business and its customers.

Using neural networks and machine learning techniques, the model analyzes borrower financial and school data to assess repayment probability. The sample dataset, provided by the business team, contains historical information about student loan recipients and their repayment outcomes.
